- When tightening image-size policy, always profile send latency on real upload path (pick -> compress -> invoke -> reward), not just final byte size.
- Prefer precomputing expensive transforms (compression) before user-confirmed send so reward/UI feedback stays responsive.
- Even when backend timing is unchanged, add explicit pending-state feedback near the affected HUD metric to avoid perceived freezes.

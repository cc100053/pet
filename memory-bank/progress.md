# Progress

## Done
- Created initial memory-bank docs: `tech-stack.md`, `architecture.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `progress.md`.
- Captured stack details from GDD into `tech-stack.md`.
- Integrated critical review updates into GDD (night mode, label mapping, UI gesture handling, opt-in ads, RLS, backend validation).
- Updated memory-bank docs to reflect new architecture, stack, and plan notes.
- Filled `implementation-plan.md` with phases, milestones, and risks.
- Added `database-schema.md` with draft tables and RLS policy examples.
- Finalized table/field naming and added RPC vs Edge Function split in schema docs.
- Updated architecture and tech stack notes to reflect the hybrid approach.
- Added `label-mapping.md` with seed mappings and quest keywords.
- Generated Supabase schema migration and seed data for label mappings/quests.
- Added `create_room` RPC and ownership transfer trigger for room owner changes.
- Added `leave_room` RPC to deactivate membership and trigger owner transfer.
- Added `regenerate_invite_code` RPC for owner-only invite refresh.
- Clarified owner-only invite code sharing in the GDD.
- Refined implementation plan with per-phase testing steps.
- Reformatted the GDD for readability without changing content.
- Added MVP designer checklist to the GDD.
- Simplified designer deliverables to interface design, component library, and pet assets.
- Added non-Figma asset handoff guidance in the GDD.
- Added asset format table and Rive material guidance to the GDD.
- Restructured GDD section 7.4 for clearer designer deliverables.
- Implemented Phase 0 scaffold: Flutter project, env setup, CI, auth gate, and profile stub.
- Added Supabase env template and README setup guidance.
- Updated architecture and tech stack docs to reflect Phase 0 modules and CI.
- Marked Phase 0 as completed in the implementation plan.
- Added `award_quest_reward` RPC to grant daily quest bonus safely.
- Added `feed_validate` Edge Function to validate labels, award feed/quest coins, and store feed messages.
- Fixed RLS recursion on `room_members` with `is_room_member` helper.
- Fixed `create_room` RPC ambiguity for `invite_code`.
- Added in-app test tools: Create Test Room + Run Feed Test.
- Added auth debug logging for JWT + UID on sign-in.
- Temporarily disabled `verify_jwt` for `feed_validate` due to Edge gateway JWT rejection; function still validates via `auth.getUser()`.
- Marked Phase 1 as completed and started Phase 2 in the implementation plan.
- Added pet state machine migration with mood boosts, poop penalties, and night mode decay.
- Wired `feed_validate` to apply pet feed actions before awarding coins.
- Added in-app pet action/state test panel (feed/clean/touch/tick).
- Applied pet state machine migration to Supabase.
- Implemented label mapping service and unit tests for matching logic.
- Implemented feed camera flow with ML Kit labeling and edge upload.
- Implemented chat room view with realtime stream, text composer, and feed cards.
- Added keyset pagination for loading older chat messages.
- Polished chat pagination UI with pull-to-refresh and loading placeholders.
- Fixed chat room sent messages not auto-updating with optimistic UI pattern.
- Removed chat room pull-to-refresh (Realtime handles new messages, scroll pagination handles old).
- Added auto-load existing room on login (no need to create test room every time).
- Fixed chat room load-more pagination (Supabase query builder is immutable, `.or()` filter wasn't being applied).
- Added "scroll to latest" button when reading older messages.

## Next
- Apply `label_mappings` and `quests` seed data in Supabase if not already loaded.
- Add integration test for feed -> Edge -> DB -> chat message.
